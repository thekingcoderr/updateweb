                The storage and handling of biometric data pose security 
                risks. If facial recognition databases are compromised, individuals' 
                sensitive information could be exposed, leading to identity theft and 
                other malicious activities.

            <pre style = "transform: translate(-10%,-30%)"> 
                Studies have shown that facial recognition systems often have higher 
                error rates for people of color, women, and other marginalized groups. 
                These biases can result in misidentification and discriminatory outcomes.
